Getopt-Hash

I have simple command line option processing needs.  I don't want to configure a list of
allowed options and I want to be able to mix-and-match single-character ("-h") with long 
("--version") options.  This module is intended to fill that role.  It processes @ARGV,
returns a hash of command line options and then gets out of your way.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
